A simple adventure game by {who?} based on a simple adventure game engine by [Adam Smith](https://github.com/rndmcnlly).

Code requirements:
- **4+ scenes based on `AdventureScene`**: scene0, scene1, scene2, scene3 (Respectively Front Door, Hallway, Kitchen, Living Room) (name at least 4 of the classes).
- **2+ scenes *not* based on `AdventureScene`**: good, bad (Endings) (name the classes).
- **2+ methods or other enhancement added to the adventure game engine to simplify my scenes**:
    - Enhancement 1: removed visible inventory in order to keep the screen from being too small (name the method and explain the use of it).
    - Enhancement 2: removed black rectangle to allow the images to show up correctly (name the method and explain the use of it).

Experience requirements:
- **4+ locations in the game world**: unsatisfied (name at least 4 of the classes).
- **2+ interactive objects in most scenes**: Front Door has 3 interactive objects, Kitchen has 5 interactive objects (describe two examples)
- **Many objects have `pointerover` messages**: All doors, key, peephole, apple, knife (describe two examples)
- **Many objects have `pointerdown` effects**: All doors, key, peephole, apple, knife (describe two examples)
- **Some objects are themselves animated**: no animations (describe two examples)
